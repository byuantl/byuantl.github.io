- # About Me
  Hey there! I’m Bowen, a third-year Engineering Physics student at the University of British Columbia with a strong interest in analog and mixed-signal design, experimental physics, and building systems that bridge physical principles with real-world hardware.

  I am drawn to physics for its ability to explain how the world works at a fundamental level, and I gravitated toward electronics as a way to make those ideas tangible. Along the way, some of the things I’ve worked on include:

  - **Analog and mixed-signal circuit design** to make amplifiers and ADCs

  - **PCB design** and **bring-up** with Altium, LTspice, and lab instrumentation for robots and satellites

  - **RF communications** and **system verification** for space-constrained hardware designing a [Dynamic Channel Emulator](https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE59415.2024.10667238) at the [UBC Radio Science Lab](https://rsl.ece.ubc.ca/)

  Outside of work, you can probably find me at a [curling rink](https://vancurl.com/index.php) or a [movie theatre](https://boxd.it/dGkGt). Feel free to check out my [resume](https://github.com/byuantl/byuantl.github.io/blob/main/assets/Bowen_Yuan_Resume.pdf) or [email me](mailto:byuan06@student.ubc.ca) if you’d like to chat :)
